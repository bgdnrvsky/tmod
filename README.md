Tmod is a tool that allows you to quickly create and manage your Minecraft modpack.

Add a remote mod to `.tmod/remotes.json` using its slug, or add already existing JAR files to `.tmod/locals/` directory.

Tmod keeps information about dependencies and incompabilites so you can add the single mod and all the necessary libraries for it will be already there !

`TODO: Write more...`
